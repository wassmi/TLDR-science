# TLDR Science: A Personal Project

A self-initiated project to simplify scientific research using natural language processing and summarization techniques.

## Overview

TLDR Science is a personal project that aims to automate the summarization of scientific research papers into concise, easy-to-understand summaries. This project showcases my skills in:

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text analysis and summarization techniques.
* **Software Development**: Designing and implementing a solution to automate summarization.
* **Critical Thinking**: Distilling complex research into key points and simple language.

## Features and Functionality

* **Summarization Algorithm**: A custom-built algorithm to extract key points and generate summaries.
* **Web Interface**: A simple web interface to input research papers and view summaries.
* **Chrome Button**: A custom Chrome button to trigger summarization with a single click.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
* **Libraries and Frameworks**: NLTK, spaCy, Flask
* **Tools**: Chrome Extension API

## Benefits

* **Improved Understanding**: Simplify complex research into easy-to-understand summaries.
* **Time-Saving**: Quickly grasp the essence of scientific studies.
* **Enhanced Productivity**: Focus on key points and insights.

## Conclusion

TLDR Science demonstrates my ability to design and implement a solution to a complex problem using NLP and software development skills. I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects and collaborations.
